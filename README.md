# Osiris
Please find in this repository the source code for the application Osiris. This application is used for visualization of the data acquired with the RT-Biolumicorder (Saini, et al. 2013). It allows the display of the photon and activity dynamics of the animals as well as the food access and light exposure. In addition, it allows doing basic group analysis and saving the figures for later publication.

Feel free to download, modify and use the application for your experiments and other purposes as far as you always share the modifications with the community in an open-source manner and reference to this depository and this publication: Katsioudi et al., 2021. Please find in the folder the main source codes as well as the stand-alone application for fast implementation.
